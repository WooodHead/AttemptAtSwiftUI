# An Attempt at Swift UI

SwiftUI lets us build declarative user interfaces in Swift. There's a new declarative UI structure that defines how our layouts look and work. Updating the UI preview automatically generates new Swift code, and changing the Swift code updates the UI preview.

I tried to replicate the UI of a well known App. My Attempt was to check how much of structure i can create with SwiftUI and results were amazing.

>I am not sure if these are the best practises to do things in SwiftUI.

            <img src = "Screenshots\WAUserDetail.png" width = 100 alt = "user detail">
        </td>
    </tr>
